## Dynamic Programming ##
This Dynamic Programming Project is based on Optimization in Fog Computing. It uses an exact solution and a parametric approximation to extend more steps.

The main script is `FogSimulateData.py.`
```
python FogSimulateData.py
-d <number of IoT devices>
-f <number of fog devices>
-s <random seed>
```
